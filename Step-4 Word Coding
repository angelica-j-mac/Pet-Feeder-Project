Task 1: Check Feeding Time
•	Read current time from RTC
•	Compare it with the feeding schedule SCHED
•	If RTC and SCHED matches, continue to the next task; else, stop and wait.

Task 2: Check food bin
•	Look at BIN (food grams in the bin)
•	If BIN = 0, send ALRT_EMPTY, LOG issue, and STOP

Task 3: Check bowl capacity
•	Work out CAP = MAX_BOWL – BOWL
•	If CAP <= 0, send ALRT_OVERFLOW, log “Bowl is FULL”, and STOP.

Task 4: Decide portion size
•	Set PORTION depending on PET_TYPE
o	If PET_TYPE == cat, then PORTION = 80 grams
o	If PET_TYPE == dog, then PORTION = 160 grams

Task 5: Calculate safe dispense amount
•	Work out ACTUAL = min (PORTION, BIN, CAP)
•	If ACTUAL = 0, log “CANNOT DISPENSE” and STOP

Task 6: Dispense Food
•	Rotate the SERVO motor to release ACTUAL grams
•	Update BIN = BIN – ACTUAL
•	Update BOWL = BOWL + ACTUAL
•	LOG action with time

Task 7: Monitor pet eating
•	Wait for 10 mins
•	Check bowl weight again (BOWL)
•	If no change, send ALRT_NOTE(“pet is not eating”)
•	If food reduced, LOG “Pet ate food”

Task 8: Finish cycle
•	Save all LOGS and ALRT
Return to idle until the next feeding time.
