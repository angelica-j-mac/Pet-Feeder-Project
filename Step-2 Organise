Step 2: Organise and Describe the Data

-	List input types (e.g., real-time clock, food level sensor, weight sensor under bowl).
-	List expected outputs (e.g., rotate motor, send alert).
-	Provide sample values and operational constraints.

Deliverable: Data table with inputs/outputs and operational parameters.

TYPE    |      ITEM                     |  SYMBOL       | SAMPLE VALUE                |  OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS (W/ CONSTRAINTS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT   | REAL TIME CLOCK               | RTC           |  09:00 , 13:00          |  Sets off scheduled tasks, needs to keep time precisely.
INPUT   | FOOD LEVEL SENSOR             | BIN           | 1200 grams              | Minimum 0 grams, cannot be negative
INPUT   | WEIGHT SENSOR                 | BOWL          | 0 grams -> 300 grams    | Must not exceed bow capacity (e.g. 300 grams)
INPUT   | PET TYPE                      | PET_TYPE      | "cat" , "dog"           | Determines portion size
INPUT   | FEEDING SCHEDULE              | FEED_SCHED    | [07:00 , 18:00]         | Atleast twice a day, Adjustable by user
INPUT   | Pet Feeding Status            | PET_HAS_EATEN | TRUE / FALSE            | Used in monitoring (simulated in software, real world sensors)
INPUT   | Bin Food Weight               | BIN_WEIGHT    | 1000 grams              |
DERIVED | Capacity left in bowl (grams) | CAP           | 500 grams - BOWL        | Must be >= 0; prevents to overflow
DERIVED | Actual grams dispensed        | ACTUAL        | 50 grams -> 130 grams   | must not exceed bin or bowl capacity
CONFIG  | Maximum bowl capacity         | MAX_BOWL      | 800 grams MAX           | Cannot be exceeded
OUTPUT  | Rotate Motor                  | SERVO         | 80 grams dispensed      | Must not rotate if bin empty or bowl is full
OUTPUT  | Update Bin Level              | UPD_BIN       | 1200 grams -> 800 grams | Decrease by dispense amount
OUTPUT  | Update Bowl Weight            | UPD_BOWL      | 0 grams -> 80 grams     | Increase by dispense amount, capped by max capacity
OUTPUT  | Alert: Bin Empty              | ALRT_EMPTY    | ERROR: Bin Empty        | Send when bin = 0 grams
OUTPUT  | Alert: Overflow Risk          | ALRT_OVERFLOW | WARN: Partial dispense  | Send when bowl nearly full, dispense limited
OUTPUT  | Alert: Food Not Eaten         | ALRT_NOT_EATEN| WARN: Food Not Eaten    | Send if bowl weight is unchanged after monitoring window
OUTPUT  | Log Event                     | LOG           | Dispense 80 grams       | Time stamped; used for records and staff review
